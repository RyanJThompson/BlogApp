# BlogApp

## Overview

A blog app built with react native, I am learning as I develop the app. The end goal is to have a blogging app where the user can create and view other blogs that were created.

I feel this is a great idea for a learn as you go app and there is a lot of base functionailty to cover and it can be built up slowly. E.g. starting off with hardcoded json to represent a database and then after creating a back-end to store blogs and account data once most UI components have been created.
